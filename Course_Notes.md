This is the start of my traveling od this course:

GLOBALS OBJECTS IN NODE:

__dirname : This object contains the name of the path were we are currently working.

__filename: This object contains the name of the file we we are currently working:

require: This is the function for consume and exports our ES modules.

module:  This object contains the module of the currently file were we are working for.

process: This object contains the info about were we are executing our program.


Modules:

In every sigle JavaScript file we have the global object "module", well this an object that give us some interesting properties, in that properties we have "exports".

The "exports" propertie let use a "require()" our module and then we can use the information of that required program to work with that information.
